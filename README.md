# Drug Interaction AI Agents

A hackathon project using AI agents to recognize patterns in drug-drug interactions.

## Components

### ðŸ©º Dr. Ordinary - Chrome Extension
A Chrome extension that uses web agents to recognize when a user is searching about a particular drug and informs them of possible drug-drug and drug-food conflicts.

**Features:**
- Detects drug searches on web pages
- Real-time drug interaction warnings
- Food-drug conflict alerts
- Non-intrusive user interface

### ðŸ”¬ Dr. Strange - Web Application
An online website that allows doctors/pharmacists to enter 2 drugs and predictively return potential conflicts that can then be tested by the doctor and later verified (similar to AlphaFold predictive algorithm).

**Features:**
- Predictive drug interaction analysis
- Doctor/pharmacist interface
- Conflict verification system
- Research and testing workflow
