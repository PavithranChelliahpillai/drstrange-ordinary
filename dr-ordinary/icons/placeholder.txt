# Icon Placeholder

For the Chrome extension to work properly, you need to add icon files to this directory:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple placeholder icons or use any medical/drug-related icons.

For now, the extension will work without icons, but you'll see a default extension icon in Chrome.
